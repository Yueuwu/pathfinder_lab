<p>Code here isn't 100% original!!!</p>
<p>On the last lab in university course I had to modify program for correct working. I had to create functions like button_start_point and others, add algorithm like Bi-directional A*, IDA* and Lee Algorithm</p>
<p>Also I had to modify Lee Algorithm. My goal was to make wave spread in diagonal not only up-down and left-right</p>

## The Lee Algorithm Example
